The following is a summary of the social role and technical (educational) characteristics of Japan's **vocational schools/specialized training colleges (vocational education and training schools)**. Important assertions are based on public documents and reports from specialized organizations (four sources other than Wikipedia).
Summary (Brief)
Japan's vocational schools/specialized training colleges are educational institutions that provide practical skills, techniques, and vocational knowledge in the short to medium term, connecting with industry and supplying work-ready personnel to the labor market. While institutionally regulated by the School Education Act, their curriculum and establishment standards are relatively flexible, allowing them to provide practical and diverse vocational education.

Which is better?
## Request
Vocational training schools are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Please rewrite the explanation and introduce it in English.
## Answaer by ChatGPT
Certainly. Below is a revised English explanation that correctly reflects the fact that vocational training schools (職業訓練校) are under the jurisdiction of Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), not the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), which governs specialized training colleges (専修学校).
This version distinguishes between the two and focuses specifically on the MHLW vocational training schools, their social role, and technical/educational characteristics, supported by four non-Wikipedia references.
Vocational Training Schools in Japan: Social Role and Technical Characteristics
(Under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare — MHLW)
Overview
Japanese vocational training schools (職業訓練校, shokugyō kunren kō) are public or private institutions designed to develop practical occupational skills and technical proficiency for workers, job seekers, and career changers.
They form a central part of Japan’s vocational capability development system, regulated by the Human Resources Development Promotion Act and supervised by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW).
Their purpose is to support employment stability, workforce re-education, and industrial adaptability in response to technological and economic change.
Social Role
Employment Support and Re-Employment Assistance
Vocational training schools provide skill development for the unemployed and those seeking career transitions. Many operate in conjunction with Hello Work (public employment security offices), directly linking training completion to job placement.
→ Reference: MHLW, Vocational Ability Development Promotion Act Overview (2024).
Regional and Industrial Workforce Development
Prefectural and municipal governments operate training centers that align with local industrial needs—such as manufacturing, caregiving, construction, or IT—to sustain regional economies and address skill shortages.
→ Reference: Japan Vocational Ability Development Association (JAVADA), Regional Vocational Training Center Reports (2023).
Support for Disadvantaged or Vulnerable Groups
Special programs target women returning to the workforce, persons with disabilities, and youth without stable employment, promoting inclusive labor participation and lifelong employability.
→ Reference: MHLW, White Paper on Labour and Economy 2023.
Contribution to National Human Resource Policy
These institutions embody Japan’s “Human Resources Development Policy” (jinzai kaihatsu seisaku), emphasizing adaptability in a rapidly changing industrial structure and supporting Japan’s transition toward digital and green economies.
→ Reference: Cabinet Office, Human Resources Development Policy 2022–2025.
Technical / Educational Characteristics
Competency-Based, Practice-Oriented Training
Curricula emphasize hands-on learning through workshops, simulators, and factory-style training environments. Skills are verified through nationally standardized Technical Certification and Skill Tests.
→ Reference: JAVADA, National Skill Testing and Certification System (2023).
Modular and Adaptive Curriculum Design
Training programs are modularized (from short-term to two-year courses) and updated rapidly to reflect new technologies such as robotics, IoT, and digital manufacturing.
Integration with Employment Services
MHLW coordinates vocational training with Hello Work to ensure alignment between labor market needs and training supply. The system uses job-placement databases and counselor-based career support.
Public–Private Partnership in Training Delivery
In addition to public vocational schools, entrusted training (委託訓練) allows private institutions and industry bodies to provide MHLW-approved programs. This expands capacity and keeps curricula responsive to emerging industries.
Current Challenges and Policy Directions
Digital Transformation (DX) of Training Content — Expanding remote and blended learning using e-learning platforms and virtual practice environments.
Reskilling and Lifelong Learning — Supporting mid-career workers in reskilling through subsidized or modular training.
Quality Assurance and Evaluation — Establishing outcome-based evaluation frameworks for training quality and employability impact.

In educating working adults, please explain the relationship between customary law, such as public order and morals in the civil code, and codified law, such as commercial code and criminal code.
## Answaer by ChatGPT
Excellent and subtle question — this connects adult education, legal literacy, and the interaction between customary norms and codified law in Japanese society.
Below is a comprehensive English explanation tailored to vocational or continuing education for working adults.
Relationship Between Customary Law and Codified Law in the Education of Working Adults (Japan Context)
Overview
In Japan’s legal system, customary law (慣習法) and codified law (制定法) coexist in a complementary relationship.
While codified law — such as the Civil Code, Commercial Code, and Criminal Code — provides the formal and written legal framework, customary law — such as norms of public order and morals (公序良俗), community practices, and business ethics — reflects the lived and evolving practices of society.
In adult and vocational education, understanding both is essential because working adults constantly operate in areas where legal rules intersect with social norms (e.g., workplace behavior, contracts, compliance, and corporate ethics).
Customary Law and “Public Order and Morals” in the Civil Code
The Civil Code, Article 90, stipulates that “a juristic act that is against public order or good morals (公序良俗) is void.”
This clause functions as a gateway for social norms — customary ethical standards, fairness, and decency — to influence the interpretation and enforcement of codified law.
In business or employment contexts, this principle ensures that contracts or workplace rules that violate basic moral standards (e.g., discrimination, excessive penalties, exploitative terms) are invalid even if the parties agreed voluntarily.
In vocational training for adults, especially in management or HR programs, this teaches that legality does not equal legitimacy — an agreement might comply with the letter of commercial or labor law but still be socially unacceptable or legally void under public order and morals.
Codified Law: Civil, Commercial, and Criminal Codes
Civil Code (民法): Governs private relations and contracts; establishes the legal basis for employment, lease, and service relationships.
Commercial Code (商法): Provides formal rules for business transactions, corporate structures, and financial conduct — ensuring predictability and trust in commercial activities.
Criminal Code (刑法): Defines punishable offenses and ensures that violations of societal order (such as fraud, embezzlement, or harassment) are sanctioned through public authority.
Together, these form the explicit (codified) dimension of social control in the workplace and economy.
The Interaction Between Customary and Codified Law
Aspect Customary Law (公序良俗・慣習法) Codified Law (制定法) Relationship
Source Social practices, moral expectations, business customs Statutes enacted by the Diet Codified law often incorporates or defers to customary law where explicit rules are absent
Function Reflects community ethics, adapts to new norms Ensures consistency, formality, and enforceability Customary law “fills gaps” and “interprets” codified norms
Example Prohibition of exploitative non-compete clauses, customary grace periods in payment Contract law, labor regulations, commercial standards Codified rules are interpreted through customary fairness
Educational Value Teaches moral reasoning, ethical sensitivity Teaches rule-based compliance Combined, they form “compliance and conscience” in professional education
Implications for Adult and Vocational Education
In programs for working adults — particularly in business law, compliance, HR management, and professional ethics — educators emphasize three integrated lessons:
Rule Literacy (法令遵守): Understanding what statutes require or prohibit.
Ethical Literacy (倫理判断): Understanding the social meaning and moral implications of conduct beyond formal legality.
Adaptive Judgment (状況判断): Applying both codified and customary standards appropriately in complex, real-world situations.
This dual literacy fosters professional autonomy, corporate responsibility, and trust — all critical in Japan’s relational business culture.
Example Case in Education
In a vocational management course, an instructor might present this scenario:
A company introduces a clause requiring employees to pay high penalties if they resign early.
Legally, under the Civil Code this is a contract clause.
But under Article 90 (public order and morals), it may be void because it unreasonably restricts individual freedom — violating social decency and fairness.
Through such case studies, adults learn to reason with both written law and social conscience, which is essential for leadership and compliance in modern workplaces.

## Request
Please introduce how public order and morals are handled in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, South Korea, and India, along with specific legal texts (preferably the original text and its English translation).
## Answaer by ChatGPT
Good—below How I compare how “public order and morals” (公序良俗 / public policy / good morals) are treated in six jurisdictions, and I give specific legal texts or leading authoritative sources (original language where available, plus an English rendering). I cite official sources or well-known translations so you can check the primary wording.
United States (common-law approach — public policy doctrine)
How it’s handled (summary).
The U.S. has no single statutory “public order and morals” clause equivalent to Japan’s Article 90. Rather, U.S. courts apply a public-policy doctrine (judge-made) to refuse enforcement of contracts or terms that offend public policy. The American Law Institute’s Restatement (Second) of Contracts summarizes the doctrine used by courts: a promise or term may be unenforceable if enforcement is outweighed by public policy interests. Courts balance private freedom of contract against public welfare. Open Casebook
Authoritative text (English): Restatement (Second) of Contracts §178 (summary text used by courts):
“A promise or other term of an agreement is unenforceable on grounds of public policy if legislation provides that it is unenforceable or the interest in its enforcement is clearly outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy against the enforcement of such terms.” Open Casebook
Representative case (historic): courts often cite principles such as ex dolo malo non oritur actio (no action arises from bad motive), and numerous U.S. state decisions apply this balancing test. For a teaching/summary source see the Restatement §178 text. Open Casebook
United Kingdom (common-law — public policy / illegality doctrine)
How it’s handled (summary).
In England & Wales the principle is judge-made: courts will not assist a claimant whose cause of action is founded on an illegal or immoral act (the maxim ex dolo malo non oritur actio). There is not a single civil code clause; instead the doctrine of illegality / public policy is developed by case law and shaped by statutes in specific areas (e.g., criminal, public order, obscenity). trans-lex.org+1
Foundational quote (Lord Mansfield, Holman v Johnson, 1775):
“The principle of public policy is this; ex dolo malo non oritur actio.” (Holman v Johnson (1775) 1 Cowp 341). trans-lex.org
Typical application: courts treat clauses or claims contrary to public policy (e.g., contracts to commit crimes, or agreements contrary to statutory public policy) as unenforceable; modern English cases refine when and how relief may nonetheless be available. Oxford Law Blogs
Germany (civil-law general clause: Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB))
How it’s handled (summary).
German civil law contains explicit general clauses that void legal transactions contrary to law or good morals. Two central provisions are § 134 BGB (statutory prohibition) and § 138 BGB (transactions contrary to good morals — sittenwidrig). These operate as bright-line rules: transactions violating statutes or fundamental moral standards are void. gesetze-im-internet.de+1
Original (German) + official English translation (from the Federal Ministry site):
§ 134 BGB (German):
“Ein Rechtsgeschäft, das gegen ein gesetzliches Verbot verstößt, ist nichtig, sofern sich nicht aus dem Gesetz ein anderes ergibt.”
English (official translation):
“A legal transaction that violates a statutory prohibition is void, unless the law leads to a different result.” gesetze-im-internet.de
§ 138 BGB (German):
“(1) Ein Rechtsgeschäft, das gegen die guten Sitten verstößt, ist nichtig.”
English (official translation):
“(1) A legal transaction that is contrary to good morals is void.” gesetze-im-internet.de+1
(Full official English BGB text available at the German government’s laws portal.) gesetze-im-internet.de
People’s Republic of China (Civil Code: general clause)
How it’s handled (summary).
China’s Civil Code (2020) explicitly requires civil actors to comply with the law and not to act against public order and good morals. The Civil Code contains a general principle that civil activities violating law, public order or good morals are prohibited — similar in role to Japan’s public-order clause. Enforcement and scope are informed by judicial interpretation and policy considerations. 全国人民代表大会+1
Original (Chinese) + English rendering (NPC / official PDF):
Civil Code, Article 8 (Chinese):
“民事主体从事民事活动，不得违反法律，不得违背公序良俗。”
English (translation):
“When conducting a civil activity, civil subjects shall not violate the law or offend public order or good morals.” 全国人民代表大会+1
(See the NPC/translated PDF of the PRC Civil Code for the official English rendering.) 全国人民代表大会+1
South Korea (Civil Act — general clause)
How it’s handled (summary).
Korean civil law contains an explicit general clause that voids juristic acts whose object is contrary to good morals and other social order. The civil-law provision functions similarly to the Japanese public-order clause: it is a general, open-textured norm that courts interpret against changing social standards and public policy. law.go.kr+1
Original (Korean) + English text (official site / government translation):
Civil Act, Article 103 (Korea) (Korean):
“선량한 풍속 기타 사회질서에 위반한 사항을 내용으로 하는 법률행위는 무효로 한다.”
English (official translation on government site):
“A juristic act which has for its object such matters as are contrary to good morals and other social order shall be null and void.” law.go.kr+1
(See the Korean government legal portal / KLRI for the official English rendering and judicial commentary.) e-Law+1
India (statutory test in contract law; constitutional public order)
How it’s handled (summary).
India uses statutory tests in contract law and constitutional limits to public freedoms. In contract law, Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 declares that the consideration or object of an agreement is unlawful if it is immoral or opposed to public policy; such agreements are void. Separately, constitutional fundamental rights may be subject to reasonable restrictions in the interests of public order, decency and morality (see Article 19 restrictions). Thus India uses both codified statutory rules and constitutional public-order terms. indiacode.nic.in
Authoritative text (English — original statutory English text):
Indian Contract Act, 1872 — Section 23 (original English):
“The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless — (among other things) — it is immoral, or opposed to public policy; …”

Short comparative notes (practical teaching points for adult learners)
Civil-law jurisdictions (Germany, China, Korea) commonly embody public-order/morals as express general clauses in their civil codes (voiding transactions contrary to statute or morals). These are textual, broad provisions that courts apply and interpret. gesetze-im-internet.de+2全国人民代表大会+2
Common-law jurisdictions (U.S., UK) rely more on judge-made public-policy/illegality doctrines (with supporting statutes in specific fields). Courts balance private contractual freedom against the public interest and may refuse enforcement when policy dictates. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts §178 is a compact articulation used in the U.S.; Lord Mansfield’s formulation anchors the English approach. Open Casebook+1
