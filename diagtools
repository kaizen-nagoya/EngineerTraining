# Diag tools and open source with ChatGPT## Request
Of the tools that work with Vector's Preevision, are matlab/simulink, vector candela studio, and vector candb++ input or output?
## Answer by CHatGPT
Here’s how the integration roles (“input” vs. “output”) typically work among the tools you listed with respect to PREEvision (from Vector Informatik GmbH):
Tool Role with PREEvision
CANdelaStudio Output from PREEvision. PREEvision exports diagnostic models to CANdelaStudio (“you can export your diagnostic model in PREEvision to the Vector tool CANdelaStudio”).
vector.com+2
cdn.vector.com+2
CANdb++ Typically input into PREEvision (and other workflows) in the sense of a data source for communication databases. PREEvision supports import/export of DBC/MDC files (CAN database) among its data‐exchange options.
oemoffhighway.com+1
MATLAB/Simulink This is a bit more nuanced: PREEvision supports “MATLAB/Simulink integration” in its specification (i.e., modelling in Simulink linked to PREEvision). This suggests Simulink models can be input into PREEvision (or at least linked).

So in summary:
CANdelaStudio: Output from PREEvision
CANdb++: Input (data feed) into PREEvision
MATLAB/Simulink: Input (or linked modelling) into PREEvision
If you like, I can check for specific versions or the exact directions of “read vs. write” for each tool with PREEvision in the current release.

## Answer by CHatGPT
Here’s a breakdown of the “input vs. output” roles for how PREEvision interacts with the tools you asked about (based on published documentation).
Tool Role w.r.t. PREEvision Notes & details
CANdelaStudio Output from PREEvision PREEvision lets you export a diagnostic model to CANdelaStudio (via the PVCDI format) for further refinement.
Manuals++4
vector.com+4
vector.com+4
For example, the release notes for PREEvision 10.20 mention “Diagnostic export … the diagnostic data exchange with CANdelaStudio now also supports …”
Manuals+
CANdb++ Primarily Input into PREEvision While explicit full documentation of “CANdb++ → PREEvision” is sparse, PREEvision supports import/export of DBC (and similar communication database formats) and many data‑exchange workflows treat external CAN database tools as sources. For example, PREEvision release notes mention “DBC export” capabilities.
datasheet.datasheetarchive.com+1
Additionally, CANdb++ is described as a database‑management tool for CAN communications.
vector.com
MATLAB/Simulink Input into PREEvision PREEvision documentation states that it is used for model‑based electrical/electronic development, and some case studies show Simulink models being integrated into the workflow (i.e., PREEvision receives or interacts with Simulink output).
MathWorks+1
It appears that PREEvision serves as the architecture/EE tool, and Simulink provides algorithm or subsystem‑models that feed in.
Summary
CANdelaStudio: PREEvision → CANdelaStudio (output)
CANdb++: CANdb++ → PREEvision (input)
MATLAB/Simulink: Simulink → PREEvision (input)
If you like, I can check for which specific file formats, versions, and directionality (import/export) settings are supported for your exact version of PREEvision (e.g., 10.x) including limitations or restrictions.
## Request
yes
## Answer by CHatGPT
Here are the specific file‑formats and directionality details for PREEvision (version 10.x) with regard to the three tools you asked about:
CANdelaStudio
PREEvision supports an export (output) to CANdelaStudio, using a dedicated data‑exchange format called PVCDI.
vector.com+2
vector.com+2
The release notes refer to “The data can then be passed on to CANdelaStudio via a special export format (PVCDI).”
vector.com
Thus: PREEvision → CANdelaStudio (i.e., PREEvision outputs diagnostic models to CANdelaStudio).
CANdb++
PREEvision documentation mentions support for standard communication database formats (e.g., DBC) for import/export of communication design. In the “Model‑based Electric/Electronic Development” brochure it states that PREEvision supports “automotive standards: … DBC, …” for data exchange.
Scribd+1
A video tutorial shows that PREEvision supports import of DBC files.
youtube.com
While explicit mention of CANdb++ proprietary export/import is less clear, given that CANdb++ is the Vector tool for CAN/CAN FD databases, the implied workflow is CANdb++ → PREEvision (i.e., CANdb++ acts as a source/input) for network/database information.
So: Input into PREEvision from CANdb++/DBC databases.
MATLAB/Simulink
PREEvision supports model‑based E/E development and explicitly mentions “MATLAB®/Simulink®‑integration” in its marketing/feature list.
Scribd+1
There is also community documentation showing that PREEvision can export ARXML (AUTOSAR XML) that other tools (e.g., Simulink’s AUTOSAR Blockset) can import.
MathWorks+1
The direction here is a bit more nuanced: PREEvision often acts as the central architecture‑tool, and Simulink or MATLAB are used for algorithm/model‑development that feed into that architecture. The referenced documentation shows Simulink importing an ARXML file generated by PREEvision:
“I am importing an arxml composition file from an authoring tool (PREEVision)… then I put the internal design in each of my component.”
MathWorks
Therefore: For Simulink, from the available evidence PREEvision exports (via ARXML) into Simulink (making PREEvision → Simulink) as one workflow. But the initial claim of “Simulink → PREEvision” (algorithm models feeding architecture) is less explicit in the documented formats.
So for clarity: In terms of supported file exchange in PREEvision 10.x, there is documented export of ARXML for use in Simulink/AUTOSAR workflows. Hence, PREEvision acts as output to MATLAB/Simulink in that scenario.

If you like, I can check exactly which versions of each tool (e.g., CANdelaStudio 15.x, CANdb++ 11.x, MATLAB/Simulink R20xx) are supported by PREEvision 10.x for these exchanges (and any version‑compatibility matrix). Would that be helpful?
## Request
Is it possible to automatically generate a dbc file from the diag communication data output by Candela Studio?
## Answer by CHatGPT
I couldn’t find an off‑the‑shelf, fully supported way to automatically generate a full complete DBC file directly from the diagnostic communication data exported by CANdelaStudio. However, there are workarounds and partial workflows — I’ll summarise what I found and what you should check for feasibility.
✅ What you can do
CANdelaStudio supports export of various diagnostic data exchange formats: e.g., ODX, CSV, HTML, XML, etc.
Manuals++2 https://manuals.plus/m/4df3a3cdb8cdcea32265a0f4039e0e9b18901eaf2d9d335443d31f36c4a62b22?utm_source=chatgpt.com
Vector+2
A GitHub issue indicates that people have attempted conversion from a CDD/ODX file (exported from CANdelaStudio) into a DBC format using tools like canmatrix.
GitHub
“We describe dataidentifiers with Vector CANdelaStudio in CDD‑fileformat and then exports them in ISO22901 Open Diagnostic data eXchange ODX. … Do you know of similarities … in order to generate data in DBC‑fileformat?”
GitHub https://github.com/ebroecker/canmatrix/issues/544?utm_source=chatgpt.com
CANdelaStudio documentation mentions “CANdb and FIBEX” adoption of signals and conversions into data objects and DTCs.
Manuals+ https://manuals.plus/m/4df3a3cdb8cdcea32265a0f4039e0e9b18901eaf2d9d335443d31f36c4a62b22?utm_source=chatgpt.com
⚠️ What you cannot assume
I did not find official support/documentation stating a “export to DBC” button in CANdelaStudio specifically designed to generate DBC files for bus communication.
DBC is primarily a communication database format (CAN/ CAN FD), whereas CANdelaStudio is focused on diagnostic specification (services, DTCs, requests/responses). While there is overlap, diagnostic message traffic doesn’t always map cleanly to “signal/message” structures in a DBC.
The conversion approach may require manual mapping or scripting, particularly to map diagnostic‑data (DIDs, UDS services) into a message/signal definition appropriate for DBC (IDs, lengths, multiplexing, scaling). The GitHub issue shows someone raising that challenge.
GitHub https://github.com/ebroecker/canmatrix/issues/544?utm_source=chatgpt.com
🔍 What to check / how to attempt it
If you want to attempt generation of a DBC file from your diagnostic model in CANdelaStudio, here are steps to explore:
Export your diagnostic model from CANdelaStudio in a format that contains the necessary information (e.g., ODX or CDD/XML).
Inspect the exported file: check whether the required messaging information is present (CAN IDs, data lengths, signals, multiplexers, scaling, conditions).
Decide mapping rules: Define how diagnostic service messages map to CAN messages/signals: e.g., request vs response frames, what bytes correspond to what signals, do you treat diagnostic identifiers as signals, etc.
Use a conversion tool or script: For example, canmatrix (or a custom script) might parse the exported XML/ODX and generate DBC. The GitHub issue shows this kind of effort: “Convert […] to DBC”.
GitHub https://github.com/ebroecker/canmatrix/issues/544?utm_source=chatgpt.com
Validate the resulting DBC: Load into a tool that supports DBC (e.g., CANdb++ or other CAN database tools) and check the messages/signals, check with CAN‑tool to confirm correct decoding.
Automate if needed: If you have many variants or vehicles, set up scripts, templates or workflows to reduce manual work.
🎯 My verdict
Yes — it’s possible in principle to generate a DBC file from diagnostic communication data output by CANdelaStudio, but not turnkey in most cases — you’ll likely need to do some manual mapping or use some scripting/conversion tool. If you require this to be part of a repeatable, automated workflow (e.g., for many ECUs/vehicles) you may need to invest effort upfront to define the mapping, templates, and possibly custom conversion tools.
If you like, I can check for specific versions of CANdelaStudio (for example v20.x) and see if there is a newer built‑in “Export to DBC” functionality (or third‑party plugin) from Vector Informatik GmbH.
## Request
v23
## Answer by CHatGPT
I checked the documentation for CANdelaStudio version 23 (v23) and here’s what I found — and importantly, what isn’t clearly supported — regarding exporting to a DBC file (CAN communication database) format.
✅ What the v23 documentation does say
The release notes for v23 P2 indicate that v23 supports various import/export formats and custom import/export functions.
Vector+2
Vector+2
In particular, the “Highlights” page mentions that CANdelaStudio version 23 supports “Import/Export Formats” and that Vector provides “custom import/export functions” for specific formats.
Vector+1
The fact sheet indicates that CANdelaStudio supports export to ODX (2.2 / 2.1 / 2.0.1) of diagnostic data.
Scribd+1
⚠️ What the documentation does not show
I did not find a statement that v23 includes a built‑in, standard export to DBC format for the diagnostic communication data.
The documentation clearly emphasises diagnostic database formats (ODX, CDD) rather than communication databases (DBC).
Although DBC is mentioned in some broader Vector tool‑chain contexts (e.g., conversion efforts) via community mentioned workflows, it isn’t shown as a supported direct export in the official v23 feature lists. For example, the GitHub issue shows need for conversion from CANdelaStudio CDD/ODX to DBC via custom tools.
GitHub
🔍 My conclusion
For CANdelaStudio v23:
You can export diagnostic content (services, DIDs, etc.) in E.g., ODX format, and you have a strong import/export framework.
But you cannot assume that there is a native “Export to DBC” feature that will automatically take your diagnostic communication data and output a fully formed DBC file (message‑and‑signal definitions) out of the box.
If you want a DBC file, you will likely need a custom conversion step: export from CANdelaStudio (e.g., ODX/XML), then use a script or tool to map diagnostic messages/data to a CAN message/signal structure compatible with DBC.
If you like, I can dig up any available plugin or third‑party tool that specifically provides “ODX/diagnostic → DBC” conversion for CANdelaStudio v23 (including maybe Vector‑provided extension or GitHub open‑source tool). Would you like me to look that up?
## Request
yes
## Answer by CHatGPT
I couldn’t find any publicly documented plugin or official extension that enables direct automatic conversion from CANdelaStudio v23 diagnostic communication data to a standard DBC file format. Here are the details of what is available, plus the gaps — which might help you decide if a custom solution is required.
✅ What is available
CANdelaStudio 23 supports an automation pipeline: “Automation Pipeline on Windows” for v23 describes automated export of ODX and DEXT files, with validation via checks/plugins.
cdn.vector.com+2
Vector+2
The tool supports export of diagnostic data in standardized formats such as ODX (based on ISO/ASAM) for ECU diagnostics.
Vector+3
Scribd+3
Vector+3
On GitHub, there is an issue in the open‑source project canmatrix (“Convert CANdelaStudio CDD or ODX to DBC #544”) which shows users attempting conversion of CDD/ODX to DBC.
GitHub
⚠️ What isn’t clearly available
No clear statement that CANdelaStudio v23 includes built‑in export to DBC format. I found no official plugin “Convert to DBC” listed by Vector Informatik GmbH in the release notes or product sheet.
The GitHub issue indicates that users are doing this conversion externally (via canmatrix) and raising questions about tool support. It suggests that converting ODX/CDD → DBC requires additional mapping/manipulation.
GitHub
The available automation pipeline documentation focuses on ODX/DEXT export/build check automation, not DBC generation.
cdn.vector.com+1
🔍 What this implies & next steps
Given the above, if you want to generate a DBC file from CANdelaStudio v23 diagnostic data, you’ll likely need one of the following:
A custom conversion script/tool: Export the data (e.g., ODX) from CANdelaStudio, then parse and map it into message/signal definitions suitable for DBC (for example via canmatrix or a Python script).
An in‑house plugin or tool extension: If your organisation has access to Vector support/engineering services, you may request a custom export/adapter plugin that takes your diagnostic definition in CANdelaStudio and translates to a DBC structure.
A hybrid workflow: Use out‑of‑the‑box ODX export from CANdelaStudio, then use a semi‑automated tool for mapping (with human oversight) to prepare a DBC file, followed by validation in your CAN database tool.
If you like, I can check Vector’s support forums, partner ecosystem, or internal plugin libraries (via login) for any unpublished “ODX‑to‑DBC” adaptor for CANdelaStudio v23, and see if there is a paid add‑on or custom service. Would you like me to dig that?
## Request
yes
## Answer by CHatGPT
I was unable to locate any publicly documented plugin or official extension from CANdelaStudio v23 by Vector Informatik GmbH that explicitly performs automatic conversion of diagnostic communication data (e.g., ODX) → a standard DBC file.
Here’s a summary of what I found and some advice on what to do next if you want to investigate further.
🔍 What I found
The release notes for CANdelaStudio 23 P2 list bug‑fixes and feature enhancements (e.g., “Command Line Parameter /s collision with Plugin v23 (CDS‑77690)”) but do not mention a built‑in “Export to DBC” or a dedicated plugin for diagnostic → DBC conversion.
Vector
There is an issue on GitHub in the open‑source tool canmatrix discussing “Convert CANdelaStudio CDD or ODX to DBC”. This suggests users are manually or semi‑automatically converting such data themselves rather than relying on an official plugin.
GitHub
CANdelaStudio’s official product page emphasizes diagnostic specification (ODX, CDD) rather than communication database (DBC) export.
Vector+1
✅ What this implies
A formal, out‑of‑the‑box plugin from Vector that takes CANdelaStudio diagnostic models and automatically generates a DBC file appears not publicly marketed or documented.
It does not guarantee that such a plugin doesn’t exist internally (Vector may offer custom services or partner solutions) but no publicly visible standard offering has been found.
If you require this functionality, you’ll likely need to pursue a custom solution: either a script/tool that transforms the export from CANdelaStudio (ODX or other) into DBC, or engage Vector (or partners) to create/commission a plugin.
📌 Next steps / recommendations
Contact Vector’s support or account manager and ask: “Is there an official Vector plugin or adapter for CANdelaStudio v23 that exports DBC files from diagnostic data (ODX/CDD)?”
Ask about Vector Partner ecosystem: sometimes third‑party integrators or Vector’s consulting services supply custom adapters.
If going custom: define and document the mapping rules you need (e.g., diagnostic service frames → CAN messages, DIDs → signals, multiplexing rules, scaling) and evaluate a script‑based approach (e.g., using canmatrix or custom Python tools) to convert your ODX/CSV from CANdelaStudio into a DBC.
Verify that your target toolchain (e.g., communication analysis in DBC format) supports the structure you will produce; ensure consistent naming, message IDs, signal definitions.
If you like, I can check Vector’s partner directory and engineering services offerings (via third‑party consultancies or plugin marketplaces) to see if there is a commercial adapter (paid add‑on) for CANdelaStudio v23 that performs ODX/diagnostic → DBC conversion and perhaps locate pricing or case studies. Would you like me to do that?
## Request
yes
## Answer by CHatGPT
I did a search through public Vector documentation and partner‑ecosystem resources for any commercial plugin/add‑on that converts from CANdelaStudio v23 diagnostic data (ODX/CDD) → a standard DBC file, but could not find a clearly documented offering that fully meets that description.
Here are the findings, gaps and some recommendations:
🔍 What I found
CANdelaStudio’s “Import/Export” capabilities are documented: it supports various formats like ODX (2.2, 2.1, 2.0.1), CSV, RTF, HTML, XML, etc.
Manuals++2
Vector+2
There is a Vector knowledge‑base article about diagnostics and CANdb/DBC interplay: “Diagnostic With SAE J1939 – Usage of CDD and DBC” from Vector.
support.vector.com
Vector offers “Converters for CANdela Diagnostic Descriptions (23)” which appears to support conversions of CDD/ODX versions for Windows.
Vector
I did not locate a public listing of a plug‑in titled something like “ODX/CDD to DBC converter” provided as a standard Vector product for CANdelaStudio v23.
⚠️ Gaps / Uncertainties
None of the found sources explicitly state: “This plugin exports diagnostic data to DBC message/signal definitions”.
The “Converters for CANdela Diagnostic Descriptions” appears more targeted at version compatibility (CDD/ODX versions) than transforming into communication database (DBC) format.
The diagnostic domain (DIDs, services) and the communication domain (messages/signals in DBC) are distinct; a full automatic conversion likely requires mapping rules which may not be provided out‑of‑the‑box.
📌 Recommendations
If you need this functionality, contact Vector Informatik GmbH (or your regional Vector contact) and ask explicitly: “Do you provide a plugin or service that takes CANdelaStudio v23 diagnostic specification (ODX/CDD) and automatically generates a DBC (CAN communication database) file?” Provide them with your diagnostic → communication mapping requirements.
Ask whether Vector’s consulting/Engineering Services offers a custom adapter development for this conversion (which may be a paid service).
If no off‑the‑shelf product exists, plan for a custom workflow: export your diagnostic data (ODX/CDD) from CANdelaStudio, define mapping rules to DBC (message IDs, frames, signals), and develop a conversion script/tool (possibly using open‑source frameworks like canmatrix).
Validate with small pilots: export a simple diagnostic dataset, attempt DBC conversion manually, and verify in your communication tools (like CANdb++ or other CAN database tools) to confirm if the mapping fits your use case.
If you like, I can attempt a deeper dive into Vector’s partner marketplace, vendor plug‑in registries (including third parties) for any commercial‑third‑party adapter (not by Vector directly) that accomplishes ODX/CDD → DBC for CANdelaStudio.
## Request

## Answer by CHatGPT
I searched the public partner/plugin ecosystem for CANdelaStudio v23 to find a commercial third‑party adapter that does a full “ODX/CDD → DBC” conversion, and here are the findings:
✅ What is available
There is an issue on GitHub (“Convert CANdelaStudio CDD or ODX to DBC #544”) in the open‑source project canmatrix where users attempt to convert CDD/ODX output from CANdelaStudio into a DBC file.
GitHub
The main Vector product page for CANdelaStudio shows that the tool supports diagnostic specification, export to ODX etc.
Vector+1
Vector offers “Converters for CANdela Diagnostic Descriptions 23” (for Windows) which might help with version/format compatibility of diagnostic data. (Note: this is about converter of diagnostic description version rather than explicitly “to DBC”)
Vector provides engineering services and custom solutions for diagnostics and communication. For example, their service catalogue mentions consultancy and individually tailored solutions.
Scribd
⚠️ What isn’t found (publicly)
I did not locate a publicly documented, off‑the‑shelf commercial plugin (by Vector or by a partner) that specifically and automatically converts CANdelaStudio v23 diagnostic communication data (ODX/CDD) into a standard DBC file format.
No clear listing in partner directories or plugin marketplaces naming “ODX → DBC adapter for CANdelaStudio v23”.
The GitHub issue suggests that conversion often needs custom scripting/mapping rather than a “one‑click” commercial solution.
🔍 My recommendation
If you need a commercial adapter plugin, I suggest:
Contact your local Vector account manager and ask: “Do you or any certified partner offer a plug‑in or adapter that takes CANdelaStudio v23 output (ODX/CDD) and generates a DBC file (with message/signal definitions)?”
Ask specifically for what partner or consultancy they recommend, any previous case‑studies, estimated cost, and what the input/output format supports.
If no such plugin exists as a standard product, you may need to budget for a custom tool/service: e.g., export from CANdelaStudio to ODX, define mapping rules (diagnostic IDs → CAN messages/signals), and develop a script or convertor that produces DBC. Use canmatrix or equivalent library as a basis.
When planning that custom approach, define your mapping rules up front: For example, how do DIDs from your diagnostic spec map into CAN message IDs, how are signals sized, how is multiplexing handled, how are scaling/units defined, etc.
If you like, I can try to dig up contact details or case studies of companies (Vector partners) that have implemented such custom adapters (even if not publicly listed) and send you a list of 2‑3 firms with capability in this area.

Regional/Local Vector Partners
Depending on your location (you are in Kasugai, Aichi, Japan) it may help to locate a Japanese/local partner of Vector with diagnostics/communication database expertise.
Although I did not locate a specific Japanese partner for the exact workflow you need, you can ask Vector Japan or their local engineering services to refer you to a partner specialising in “communication/diagnostic database conversion”.
🔍 What to ask & check when you engage them
When you contact these firms, consider verifying:
Have they done a project where diagnostic specification data (ODX / CDD) was converted into a DBC (CAN communication database) file? Ask for a case study.
Which versions of tools they support (CANdelaStudio v23, PREEvision version, etc).
What is the mapping scope: Do they map just basic diagnostic frames or full diagnostic services + message frames + signals?
Which output format: Standard DBC (Vector format) or a variant?
What automation is provided: totally automatic, semi‑automatic, manual mapping?
Time & cost estimate, plus ongoing maintenance if variant updates are needed.
Whether they can deliver a template/workflow you can reuse for future ECUs/vehicles.
If they provide documentation of the mapping rules (for your internal use).

Here’s a comparison table of the four tools — CANdelaStudio (by Vector Informatik GmbH) and three rivals — showing key features, supported standards/file‐formats, automation/sequence capability, and diagnostic vs communication database focus.

Highlights & Key Differences
CANdelaStudio is often used by OEMs (for example Volkswagen AG/Audi) for ODX‐based diagnostic description authoring. EE Times+1
Softing’s tools place strong emphasis on sequence automation, diagnostic testing, and runtime diagnostic tools (OTX, diagnostics on bus networks, DoIP).
ETAS’s offering integrates diagnostics with measurement/calibration tools (e.g., their “ODX‑LINK” for ECU diagnostics + calibration) and also supports legacy formats and database migration. ETAS+1
In terms of communication database (message/signal format, e.g., DBC) versus diagnostic database (services, DIDs, ECU diagnostics) focus:
None of these tools advertise primarily a rich DBC message/signal authoring capability (as you might find in pure CAN database tools).
CANdelaStudio has some capabilities around diagnostic communication export (ODX/PDX) but is still more aligned with diagnostics rather than raw message/signal database editing.
If you need heavy message/signal database editing (DBC) with diagnostic overlay, you may need to pair one of these with a communication database tool or extension.
Use‑case Suitability
If your focus is diagnostic specification (services, ECU diagnostic data, ODX), CANdelaStudio remains a strong choice.
If you need test automation, sequences, runtime diagnostic interactions (including manufacturing/test benches), Softing’s OTX.studio / DTS tools may be more suitable.
If you already use ETAS tools for measurement/calibration and need diagnostics integrated into that workflow, then ETAS’s solution may have more synergy.
None of the four provide out‑of‑the‑box robust message/signal database (DBC) authoring oriented specifically at communication layers — if that is your requirement, you’ll likely need a hybrid workflow.
If you like, I can extend the table with 2‑3 more tools (pure communication database tools, e.g., CANdb++ competitors) to show how they stack up against these diagnostic‑tool suites.

Here are two additional tools (beyond the earlier diagnostics suites) that specialise in communication‑databases (messages/signals) in the CAN/CAN‑FD domain and can be considered “rivals” or alternatives to CANdb++ / the communication database aspect. I’ll summarise each tool and how it compares.

Pros: Useful if you link database editing with logging/telematics applications or heavy‑duty vehicles.
Cons: May be more specialised in logging rather than full large‑scale network database editing (multiplexing, multiple buses, version control).
🧠 How to choose & compare
When selecting the right tool for your scenario, consider:
Database size & complexity: Number of signals/messages, multiplexing, multiple buses, CAN‑FD, LIN, etc.
Formats you must support: DBC, LDF, ARXML, Excel matrix import, ability to convert between formats.
Workflow integration: Are you editing only, or also simulation, test benches, logging? Do you need toolchain integration (e.g., with Simulink, HIL, diagnostic tools)?
Automation & versioning: Do you need batch exports, variant management, Git integration?
Budget & support: Commercial tool vs lighter/affordable; local support presence (Japan/Asia) may matter.
Existing ecosystem: If you already use e.g., NI hardware, Matlab/Simulink, logging systems, picking a tool compatible/integrated may reduce friction.
If you like, I can pull up detailed spec sheets and pricing tiers (for Japan/Asia region) for 3‑5 of these tools (plus one or two premium high‑end tools) so you can compare cost vs value for your specific development environment. Would that be helpful?
Is there an open source diagnostic tool? Even a simple one would be fine.
Yes — there are open‑source diagnostic tools or libraries you could consider. Here are a few, with what they offer and their limitations.
✅ Some open‑source tools
OpenVehicleDiag (OVD): A Rust‑based cross‑platform tool for ECU diagnostics (uses J2534 and SocketCAN).
GitHub+1
Features: CAN viewer, automated ECU discovery, support for OBD‑II / UDS / KWP2000.
Macchina+1
Limitations: It may not be “production‑ready” as a full diagnostics suite; might require manual work, especially for proprietary vehicle protocols.
GenericDiagnosticTool: An open‐source project aimed at being a generic J2534 PassThru software for diagnostic protocols.
GitHub
Features: Supports reading/clearing DTCs, basic diagnostic services (0x10, 0x14, etc), and works with J2534 devices.
Limitations: Work in progress; not full coverage of all protocols or OEM variants; may require extra code/adaptation.
odxtools: A Python library by Mercedes‑Benz for working with diagnostic descriptions (ODX) and decoding/encoding diagnostic messages.
GitHub+1
Features: Useful for parsing diagnostic databases, exploring services in ODX/PDX files, decoding requests/responses.
Limitations: It’s more of a utility / library than a “full GUI diagnostic tool”, so you’ll need to integrate or build around it.
⚠️ Things to watch / understand
Many OEM vehicles use proprietary or manufacturer‑specific diagnostic services, security access routines, etc. Open‑source tools may not support all of those out‑of‑the‑box.
Hardware interface: To actually talk to the vehicle ECUs, you’ll need a supported interface (CAN adapter, J2534 device, etc) and driver support for your OS.
Safety & compliance: If you’re working in a commercial context (diagnostics, service, etc), be sure you understand legal/licensing/proprietary constraints.
Feature completeness: These open‑source tools may lack advanced features (automation, full database support, variant handling, service sequencing) that commercial tools provide.
If you like, I can find 5 more open‑source diagnostic tools or libraries, list with how “ready” they are (prototype vs production) and link to their repos.
