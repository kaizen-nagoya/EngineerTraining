# git jira automation with ChatGPT
## Request
How can we get people who manually enter data into Jira to get used to automating things like CI/CO using git tools like bitbucket?
## Answer by ChatGPT
Getting people who are used to manual Jira updates to adopt automation like CI/CD with Git/Bitbucket is as much about behavioral change and education as it is about technology. Here’s a structured approach:
Start with Awareness and Education
Explain the “why” clearly:
Manual updates are error-prone and slow.
Automation reduces repetitive work and improves traceability.
CI/CD ensures code quality and faster delivery.
Hands-on workshops:
Show simple examples: pushing a branch triggers a pipeline and automatically updates Jira status.
Demonstrate Bitbucket Pipelines, Jira automation rules, and hooks in a sandbox project.
Tip: People resist what they don’t understand. Visuals showing the flow “Git commit → CI → Jira update → deployment” help.
Introduce Incremental Automation
Don’t switch everything at once. Start small:
Automate one repetitive task first, like auto-transitioning Jira issues when code is merged.
Use Bitbucket webhooks or Jira Automation for lightweight automation.
Celebrate small wins to show tangible benefits (time saved, fewer errors).
Integrate Jira With Git Tools
Use Jira Smart Commits:
Developers can include Jira IDs in commit messages to automatically transition issues or log work.
Configure automatic updates:
Branch creation → Jira issue moves to “In Progress”.
Merge/pull request → Jira issue moves to “Code Review” or “Done”.
Use Bitbucket Pipelines to trigger builds and deployments and reflect status in Jira.
Provide Templates and Examples
Pre-made branch naming templates: feature/JIRA-123-description.
Pre-built CI/CD pipeline snippets with Jira integration.
Share success stories within the team: “Before automation we spent 5 hours per week updating Jira; now it’s automatic.”
Encourage a Culture of Automation
Make manual work less attractive:
Set expectations that Jira updates via manual entry should be minimized.
Reward automation adoption:
Highlight contributors who set up pipelines, automated workflows, or improved CI/CD processes.
Lead by example:
Senior engineers or team leads should model automated workflows.
Offer Continuous Support
Q&A sessions, office hours, or pair programming sessions to ease the transition.
Documentation and cheat sheets for common tasks (commits, pull requests, smart commits, pipeline triggers).
Track Progress
Use metrics to show impact:
Time spent on Jira updates.
Number of automated transitions.
Build frequency or deployment speed.
💡 Key Principle: Humans adopt automation best when they see immediate benefit and when the learning curve is manageable. If the first experience is frustrating, they revert to manual methods. Start small, show wins, and scale gradually.
If you want, I can sketch a practical “first automation step” workflow specifically for someone who currently only updates Jira manually, showing exactly how Git/Bitbucket and Jira can replace that manual step. It would be a visual step-by-step guide.
Do you want me to do that?
